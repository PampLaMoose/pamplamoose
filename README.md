# Project Portfolio

Welcome to my code repository! This GitHub repository showcases some of the major projects I have completed in the fields of **Machine Learning**, **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**, and **Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations**. Each project is organized into its respective folder for easy navigation.

## Folder Structure

- **Machine Learning**
    - Contains code and projects focused on machine learning algorithms, data processing, and predictive modeling. These projects explore a range of topics, from supervised and unsupervised learning to neural networks and optimization techniques.

- **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**
    - This section includes my implementations of FEA for various mechanical and structural problems. You'll find meshing algorithms, stress analysis, simulation post-processing scripts, and debugging solutions for FEA algorithms.

- **Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations**
    - Projects related to molecular dynamics simulations, including the study of atomic-scale interactions, material behavior at the molecular level, and analytical models for coupled systems. Code for post-processing simulation data is also available here.
