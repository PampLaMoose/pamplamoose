# Project Portfolio

Welcome to my code repository! This GitHub repository showcases some of the major and mini projects I have completed in the fields of **Machine Learning**, **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**, and **Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations**. Each project is organized into its respective folder for navigation.

## Folder Structure

- **Machine Learning**
    - Contains code and projects focused on machine learning algorithms, data processing, and predictive modeling. These projects explore a range of topics, from supervised and unsupervised learning to neural networks and mathematical optimization algorithms.

- **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**
    - This section includes my implementations of FEA for various mechanical and structural problems. You'll find meshing algorithms, stress analysis, simulation post-processing scripts.

- **Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations**
    - Projects related to molecular dynamics simulations, including mini project of atomic-scale interactions, material behavior at the molecular level, and post-processed data for OVITO
